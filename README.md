Code used for analyses

All folders needed to run the code are uploaded. Their contents are classified in the following way:


/data/experiment/*

- Raw RNA-seq counts and metadata of Dianthus broteri petal tissue samples analyzed.


/data/module_gene_names/*

- Normalized gene count data in each module detected for diploids GCN


/data/exp_*

- Module conservation scores obtained in experimental data analysis


/data/sim_*

- Module conservation scores obtained in simulated data analysis


/RData/Modules_2p.RData

- Output of blockwiseModule: modules obtained via hierarchical clustering in diploids

  
/RData/Modules_2p_attributes.RData

- Module structure information studied in diploids GCN


/RData/exp_data_Zsummaries/*

- Zsummaries and conservation scores obtained in experimental data analysis


/RData/sim_data_Zsummaries/*

- Zsummaries and conservation scores obtained in simulated data analysis


/RData/modules_exp/*

- Module information and stats obtained via comparative analisis of natural and synthetic tetraploids.**

  
/RData/modules_sim/*

- Module information and stats obtained via comparative analisis of simulated tetraploids.**

  
/RData/sim_datExpr/*

- Simulated gene expression data.**



**= files for the smallest module are provided as an example.
